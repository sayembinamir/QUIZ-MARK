                .forEach() --> Is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.If we want to do something on each element, do not modify it except ruturn.
        <br> <br>
                .map() --> Cxecutes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        <br><br>
                .filter() --> Checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.Can't do anything extra.
        <br><br>
                .find() --> Method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.The first one will not give an array ,it will just show a digit.

              Local storage is a mechanism for storing key/value pairs in the browser. The data is stored indefinitely, even after the browser is closed, and is accessible across different tabs and windows of the same browser. Local storage can store up to 5-10 MB of data depending on the browser. The data is not sent to the server with each HTTP request, but can be accessed and manipulated by JavaScript code running on the same domain. <br><br>
              Session storage is similar to local storage, but the data is only accessible within the current session. The data is stored until the browser tab or window is closed. Session storage can store up to 5-10 MB of data depending on the browser. The data is not sent to the server with each HTTP request, but can be accessed and manipulated by JavaScript code running on the same domain. <br><br>
              Cookies are small text files that are stored on the client's machine by the browser. They are typically used to store user preferences and login information. Cookies have a smaller storage limit (typically around 4 KB) compared to local storage and session storage. Cookies can be set with an expiration date, and can be either persistent (stored on the client's machine even after the browser is closed) or session-only (deleted when the browser is closed). Cookies are sent to the server with each HTTP request for the same domain, which can affect performance.

              The event loop is a JavaScript mechanism that allows the handling of multiple tasks (such as user input and network requests) without blocking the main thread of execution. It continuously checks the event queue for new events to process, executes the associated callback functions, and adds new events to the queue when necessary. By using asynchronous APIs and the event loop, JavaScript can handle multiple tasks concurrently.

                An array function named quizTimer is declared.  Where dismiss is given as a parameter, the interval count will start if the condition parameter matches.  By converting 60 seconds to 1 minute, every minute is counted which is shown on the display with innerHTML.  Now if the countdown is not divisible by 2 then the given text color is removed from its classlist, thus the inactive color for even numbers and the active (red-700) color for odd numbers are shown with this function.

                ChooseQuiz is an array function that takes two parameters.  Now a variable named isExist is taken, here the data from the answer is compared between the ID in the data and the ID of the user's click.  Now the condition is executed that the serial mark count will increase when the id of the user's click serial and the data match. Finally the displayAnswer() function is called to display the answer.
